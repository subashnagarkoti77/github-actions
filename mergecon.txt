A merge conflict happens when Git tries to combine changes from two different branches (or commits)
 but cannot automatically figure out how to merge them because the changes overlap or contradict each other.

This usually occurs when:

Two people edit the same line in a file.
One person deletes a file while another person edits it.
Changes in one branch conflict with changes in another branch.
How to Resolve a Merge Conflict?
Open the conflicted file(s).
Look for the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
Decide which changes to keep:
Your changes (above =======)
Incoming changes (below =======)
Or merge both manually.
Remove the conflict markers.
Save the file.
